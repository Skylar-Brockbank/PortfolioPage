      <p>
        I was always a bit of a weird kid. When I was given a present, I was usually more excited for the box than for the contents. My way of playing with my toys was taking them apart and using the pieces to build new toys. When I was 12 my mom had to go into the office on a saturday, and this time she decided to bring me along. I had an hour to kill with a darkened cubicle and a borrowed desktop, so I followed along with a youtube tutorial to make my first batch program (a window with a simplified version of the matrix raining code effect). That was the moment I wanted to be a programmer. I built more useful batch scripts, and some basic flash games. I made it to highschool and fell in love with programming again when I took programming 1. Getting to work with others who were as excited as I was completely changed the game. I had so much fun, that I convinced the AP Computer Science teacher to give me special permission to join his class as a sophmore. I barely passes with a C. Shaken I took a break from programming. I finished highschool and a brief stint with PCC where I took a single game design class just to get the credit I needed. I started working full time, and switched between companies, until I landed in the accounting department of a sheet metal company. I had a coworker who sent me his auto hot key scripts, and I fell in love again. I started automating every repetitive process. I started building bigger and better spreadsheets, and applying my visual basic knowledge to crystal reports. I learned how to use SQL from my report writing, and made my reports run even faster. I began to notice that the times I truly enjoyed my job were the times I got to program. So I decided to commit. I quit and joined Epicodus, and so far it's been fantastic.

        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <p>
          I have a lot of hobbies, and I pick up new ones all the time. The hobbies I currently do regularly include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reading</li>
          <li>GMing TTRPGs</li>
          <li>Reading</li>
          <li>Cooking</li>
          <li>Baking</li>
          <li>Chemistry</li>
          <li>Digital Art</li>
          <li>Practicing Guitar</li>
          <li>Playing Piano</li>
          <li>Leather Working</li>
          <li>Watching Anime</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I love to learn new things. The feeling of being b ad at something and then incrementally getting better makes me happy. When It comes to <strong>Interests</strong>. I tend to be a rabbit hole person. I love to know how things work and why things happen the way that they do. I've researched string theory, tax law, what makes babies laugh, and polynesian stick charts, in a single sitting. When It comes to Interests, <span id="tokenSpan">I'm interested in anything that has a system.</span>
